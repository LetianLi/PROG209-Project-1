# PROG209-Project-1

A task manager extended in functionality from HW5's collaboration with Nicholas Jones.

Combines HW5 through HW7.

## Instructions:

Use jQuery Mobile to construct a SPA (single page application)

1. Using jQuery Mobile have a welcome page that makes it clear what the site does
and at least 3* other pages. Have a jQuery Mobile NavBar as appropriate (some
pages possibly should not be navigated to from the NavBar, but rather from the
clickable `<li>`'s). [6 points]
2. The 3 other pages must all base part of their functionality on some common data
that is used on each of the 3 pages. [6 points]
3. At least one of those pages must display data in `<li>`'s that are clickable, and the
result of clicking any one `<li>` must result in something happening that is unique
to that particular `<li>`. [4 points]
4. This common data must be stored and accessed as "master data" on the node
server using node GET and POST calls to the server (DELETE and PUT
(update) are good to have, but not required). [7 points]
5. The data on the server should be persisted to a file such that stopping the node
server and restarting does not lose data. [3 points]
6. Use the theme roller to create a colorful interface. [2 points]
7. Present this running app (or the game app) to the class during our Finals day. [2
points]
